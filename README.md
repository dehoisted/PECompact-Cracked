PECompact Cracked - Command Line &amp; GUI Tool (NO TRIAL) 

To use, download the ZIP file of this repository, then extract it.                                                                                                                  
Then find & run "PECompact_Gui_Cracked.exe" (GUI) or "PEC2.exe" (command line tool) to use PECompact Cracked.                                                                                                                                                    
Don't remove or rename any files in the main directory.    

### Notes
All cracked by me, no one else, although there are most likely other cracked versions out there.                                                               
Documentation for PECompact itself can be found in "PEC2.CHM" (compiled HTML help file)
Lastly, this software is old, so newer executables or DLL's may fail at being compressed.

## About PECompact
[PECompact](https://bitsum.com/portfolio/pecompact/) is a windows executable (and DLL) compressor.                                                                                                           
Orginally had a week or so trial to use the software.                                                                                                        
Was made around 2010, but it has aged well - compression works fine for most executables.

### Features
+ Lots of methods & options for compression
+ Can also work as a method of obfuscation for your files
+ You can select your own API hook plugins

## Tools
PECompact comes with some useful extra tools, which SHOULD be all in the same directory.                                                                        
These tools are suprisingly useful, execute them for additional information.                                                                                    
Note: All extra tools are command line only.

Tool list:
- lzma.exe
- PESubsys.exe
- petrim.exe
- PEWaterMark.exe
- peclassify.exe
- PEChksum.exe
