-- Info --
PECompact is a windows executable (and DLL) compressor.
It can work as obfuscation for your files.
PECompact has lots of options for compression.
It orginally had a week or so trial to use the software. (not anymore)
Note: This software is old, so newer executables or DLL's may not work for compression.

-- Extra Tools --
PECompact comes with some useful extra tools, which SHOULD be in your current directory.
These tools are suprisingly useful, execute them for additional information.
Note: All extra tools are command line only.
